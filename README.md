**Subjectivity Analysis Project**

**Project Overview**
This project presents an interactive subjectivity analysis tool developed in Python, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify sentences into subjective or objective categories. It adapts and improves through user feedback, demonstrating practical application in machine learning.

**Installation**
Before running the project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd [project directory]`.
3. Install required packages: `pip install nltk`.

**Features**
- Subjectivity Classification: Classifies sentences using NLP techniques.
- Interactive Learning: Incorporates user feedback for model improvement.
- Model Persistence: Maintains the trained model state over sessions using serialization.
- User-Friendly Interface: Command-line interface for easy interaction.

**Technologies Used**
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): This project utilizes NLTK for its comprehensive text processing libraries, essential for tasks like classification and tokenization in NLP.
- Naive Bayes Classifier: Employs this probabilistic classifier for its effectiveness in text classification, representing an application of probabilistic modeling in AI.
- Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction: Techniques in NLP are used for transforming textual data into a machine learning-compatible format.
- Model Persistence (Pickle module in Python): The tool uses Python's pickle for serializing the machine learning model, enabling long-term model training and usage.
- Interactive User Feedback Loop: Designed to adapt to user input
